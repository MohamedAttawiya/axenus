        <h1>Where ETHRIX meets the crowds who love ethanol power</h1>
        <p>
          We show up at the events that push ethanol platforms the hardest—because our chemistry was born from the same garages,
          dyno bays, and late-night pit lanes. Here’s where you’ll find us capturing stories, fueling builds, and looking for the
          next partner to champion with ETHRIX products.

          <p>
            Every stop on our calendar pairs real racing pressure with communities that obsess over reliable ethanol chemistry.
            We listen trackside, iterate in the lab, and come back with formulations that keep engines cool, injectors clean, and
            tuners confident in every pour.

          <p>
            If you are building momentum in these paddocks, we want to sponsor you with ETHRIX additives, on-call lab support, and
            data-backed storytelling that puts your program in front of new fans.

          <h3>A hybrid of racing, drifting, and time-attack with music festival energy</h3>
          <p>
            From Midwest mainstays in Michigan to the Midwest South in Kentucky—and a touring slate that never sleeps—Gridlife
            attracts drivers who abuse E85 all weekend long. Our banner in the infield isn’t just decoration; it’s an invite for
            grassroots and pro teams to test ETHRIX Absolu for fuel stability, Ignis for cooler charge temps, and Flux to keep
            injector flow consistent after every hot lap.

          <p class="event-block__cta">We’re actively looking to back builders and media crews who carry the Axen Labs ethos into the next Gridlife stop.</p>

          <h3>Massive drift grids, hardcore tuner crowds, and podium pressure</h3>
          <p>
            The FD calendar—from Long Beach and Atlanta to Englishtown, St. Louis, and Irwindale—demands ethanol that stays
            consistent across wild temperature swings and brutal tire-shredding runs. With ETHRIX in the tank, teams get repeatable
            ignition timing, smoother cold starts, and peace of mind that fuel quality isn’t the variable keeping them off the box.
          </p>
          <p class="event-block__cta">We’re ready to sponsor emerging FD teams who want the science—and the support crew—to back their championship push.</p>

          <h3>Grassroots drag racing with open paddocks and real feedback loops</h3>
          <p>
            Orlando’s E85-heavy scene is a proving ground for high-boost street cars and weekend warriors alike. We stage with the
            community, hand out ETHRIX samples, and gather real-world data on how Absolu and Ignis handle repeat passes in humid,
            heat-soaked conditions. That feedback feeds our lab iterations and keeps our chemistry aligned with the racers who rely
            on it.
