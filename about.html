    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>From refinery floors to precision laboratories — Axen Labs was born from hands-on fuel engineering and two decades of real-world performance experience.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-content">
    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Axen Labs traces its roots to <strong>Gateway Ethanol LLC</strong>, where our founders worked as employees advancing
        ethanol-blend fuel technologies in the early 2000s. When Gateway Ethanol LLC ceased operations in 2009, we refused to let that innovation end there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Re-established independently as <strong>Axen Labs</strong>, we continued refining high-purity ethanol and additive chemistry —
        this time with a sharper focus on efficiency, calibration, and measurable performance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Experience & Presence</h2>
      <p>
        With over <strong>15 years of field-tested expertise</strong>, Axen Labs operates both as a research-driven brand and a practical supplier.
        Our Ohio-based outlet has served regional performance and agricultural markets — particularly ethanol-enhanced fuels for tractors and heavy machinery — with consistency and integrity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Team</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a close-knit team of five engineers and specialists — each committed to advancing fuel chemistry through verifiable data, not speculation.
        Every formulation, from concept to field test, reflects our shared belief in one principle:
        <em>Precision. Proven.</em>
